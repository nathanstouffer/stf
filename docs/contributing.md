# Contributing

- priorities
  1. correctness
  2. maintainability
  3. performance
- `snake_case` naming convention
- `*.hpp` file names
- fully qualify include paths (eg `#include "stf/math/vector.hpp"`)
- prefer `#ifndef` header guards to `#pragma once`

# Releases

TODO document this once a release process is settled on
